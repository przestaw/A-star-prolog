# A-star algorithm in prolog

Program created for Symbolic Programming Languages on university. For easier understanding of the program most of the lines are commented.

## How-To

To run this algorithm you need to define set of vertices, indices and set goal as in *roadmap.pl*.

Main procedure is calld like : ``start_A_star(InitState, PathCost)``
where:
- *InitState* is start point,
- *PathCost* is resulting cost of travel form start to goal
